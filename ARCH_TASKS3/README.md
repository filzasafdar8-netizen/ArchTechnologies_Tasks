Task: Lost Data Retrieval

Scenario:
Files were accidentally deleted from D:\TASK3_TESTRECOVERY (NTFS / EFI GPT).

Recovery Attempt:
- Tool: TestDisk (command-line) / Recuva
- Destination folder: D:\RecoveredFiles
- Recovery attempt documented, but no files were actually recovered

Conclusion:
Even though files could not be recovered, the process demonstrates safe data recovery attempts in a controlled test environment.
